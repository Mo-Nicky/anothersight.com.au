Aimee Marks is my new hero and I'm pretty sure she will be yours after you read this article. She found out by coincidence 
that most tampons contain plastics and chemicals. Awesome knowing where the tampons go ... 
So, shocked by her findings, she developed (the first) organic tampons named TOM which is short for Time of Month. 
So, a big thanks to Aimee, for keeping our insides healthy as well.
