One of my favourite design stores in Melbourne and owned by dear friend Samantha is Design Dispensary.

The stuff in there has a very European feel, and most of it is in fact imported from Europe and probably the reason why 
I like it so much, it reminds me of home. 

One of my favourite items - which is on order for my sweetest heart - is the Bellevue Board with the three deers engraved in it.

There are also boards with other engravements like a bear, elephants, a surfer, and many more. So if you 
like chopping in style, this is definitely something for you.
