Why not try a vegan meal, is what I thought when I was on a hens party in the Panamadining in Smith street
downtown Melbourne. I did not feel like meat and was curious about this option. And as you would expect - hence the post -  it was delicious.
And what I loved even more about it, is that it was a "happy meal" as in I ate just plants. And that, to be honest, feels even better.
