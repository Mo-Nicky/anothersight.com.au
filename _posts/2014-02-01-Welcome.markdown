I love drawing cards. 
I usually start my day like this because it's usually fun and uplifting. 
One morning, I drew this card saying: Mother earth is under a lot of stress now it's your turn to do something back.

Holy crap, not really a card I was waiting for. 
And what does this mean? What can I do or better yet do I want to do to de-stress entire earth....

As the only things I could think about were volunteering to clean up beaches, marching for less violence in Syria 
and chaining myself to trees in the rainforest to keep them from being cut ,which of course are great causes 
but not entirely something I see myself doing, I chose to ignore the card. 

A few months in, while I was already learning editing images in photoshop, making banners in flash, 
writing html and styling html in CSS I came up with the idea of this site.

You see, I am already trying to live a life that makes me happier and one that is less 
straining for the world we live in so I thought, why not inspire others by sharing this? 
And if there are a few people inspired by what I share then that means I'm helping 
to lessen the burden on Mrs E.

So in short:  Making yourself, others and our planet a happier place. That's what this site's about. 
So welcome to my site d'happiness, I hope you like.
