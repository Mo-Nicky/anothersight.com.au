When Sacha Goldberg learned his nana was suffering from depression he came up with a series of photo's
portraying like a superhero. What do you think happened after the sessions? Correct; happy Nana.

So pick up your phone and make a play date today. Do anything that would put a smile on theirs
and yours. And if, like me, your grandparents are far far away no need to be bummed, just borrow them.

Have fun. Yeww!
