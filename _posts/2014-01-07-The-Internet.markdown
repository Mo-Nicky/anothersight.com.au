When I first heard this song I had a flashback to the late 70's beginning of the 80's, when Michael Jackson, Kool and the Gang and El Debarge ruled all the music stations.

Hearing this song brings me to an instant relaxed state.

I absolutely love it. 

Click anywhere in the player to start it. If you found out how to pause it ... good on you.
